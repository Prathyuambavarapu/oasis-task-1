            <h2>Like Nature<br><span>Be Creative</span></h2>
            <p>
                We are living in challenging times and urgently
                need new ideas for systems and solutions to
                overcome the current crisis – from climate
                change to pandemics. It is therefore not surprising
                that creativity is regarded as one of the most 
                important future skills. Creativity has many
                flavours — artistic or professional — and each has
                its specifics. Regardless of the type, creativity involves
                the active use of imagination and developing original ideas
                to create something new. Fortunately creativity is the
                natural order of life and part of being human.
                Everybody is creative, but some seem to be able to 
                activate their innate creativity better than others.
                My experience as an author and screenwriter is that 
                spending time in nature is very helpful. For centuries,
                writers, poets, and philosophers intuitively drew inspiration
                from beautiful landscapes far from the distractions of the cities.
